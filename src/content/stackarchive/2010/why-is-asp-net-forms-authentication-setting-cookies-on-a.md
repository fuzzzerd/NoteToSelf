*Someone [asked on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4208089):*

> I have an ASP.NET (MVC) website that is serving static content (images) as well as dynamic content from the same domain. The site uses forms auth, and has a login controller. There have been some very strange / irregular issues with people finding themselves logged in or out at random intervals, and we've tracked it down to an issue with a reverse proxy caching an image file that has a set-cookie response header that sets the auth cookie. Once this is cached, everyone then gets the same auth cookie, which leads to some very weird outcomes.
> 
> My question is - how on earth would an image get a set-cookie header in the first place? What is the ASP.NET forms authentication module doing to cause this - surely it sets the cookie on the main HTML content response. I get that the auth cookie is then sent with all subsequent requests to the domain, but I cannot figure out how the cookie is set in the first place.

*I posted the following answer:*

Because you can use Forms Authentication to secure static content.
