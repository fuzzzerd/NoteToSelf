Summer is hot. I like sweets. I derrived my recipe from an ~~ancient~~ older [Chicago Tribunte article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/1990/07/26/to-make-your-own-italian-ice-use-sugar-fruit-and-muscle/).

## Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water
- 20 strawberries (substitute a similar volume of your favorite fruit)
- 6 cups ice cubes

## Dirctions

The first step is to make our fruit sugar mixture:

1. Dice fruit into small pieces.
1. Make simple syrup: Mix 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water, boil until sugar is disolved.
1. Mix 1 cup of hot simple syrup with diced fruit.
1. Allow to cool, and refrigerate overnight.

_Note: this simple syrup recipe leaves a little extra for other uses._

The second step is to make italian ice:

1. Pour the fruit and sugar mixture over 6 cups of ice. Blend with a powerful blender until smooth.

You can eat it right away, but it can be a little runny after being in the blender. I put it into a freezer safe container for an hour or two before serving. If frozen overnight, it may need to thaw for a few minutes before serving.

## Shortcut

If you have symple syrup already and don't want to wait, simply throw 1 cup of symple syrup, fruit, and 6 cups ice into blender.

## Enjoy

Eat it quick.
