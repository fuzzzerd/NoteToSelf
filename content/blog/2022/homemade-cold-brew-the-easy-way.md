I love coffee, and cold coffee is my favorite. I often get asked about my cold brew process, so I'm writing it down to share with everyone.

## Equipment

You can use any equipment you like, but here's what you will need.

- Two containers (roughly equal size) and large enough to hold your cold brew.
- Sieve / Coffee filters.

I use a pair of large mason jars, because they have measurements on the side which is helpful for the Process.

## Process

### Preparing a batch

I start with a 3:1 ratio of water to grounds.

1. I put the grounds into my mason jar, filling about to the 500ml line.
2. Fill to 1750ml line with cold water.
3. Shake or stir the mixture up to ensure all grounds are wet.
4. Throw it in the fridge for 18-24 hours.

It doesn't hurt to stir up the batch once or twice while its in the fridge cold brewing, just make sure not to do it right before you strain it out, as that'll make it more difficult to get the grounds out.

### Handling a steeped/brewed batch

Strain the grounds out, I use my sieve to go between my two jars a couple times, to catch the most grounds as possible.

Once you have strained to your satisfaction, you now have cold brew **concentrate!**

## Results

The above process makes a nice concentrate. I recommend diluting with a 60/40 concentrate to additional cold water mixture, though you will want to zero in on the exact amount of additional water you want to add to your concentrate.
