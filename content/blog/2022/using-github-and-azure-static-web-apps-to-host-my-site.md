Hooking up Azure Static Web Apps to a Github repository is very easy and works incredibly well.

Using Github actions, and a managed secret deployment key on the Azure side, the I used the default integration yml generated by Azure to set up continuous integration action. Out of the box, it creates a new environment for each pull request on the repository with a unique url. This is a useful feature for managing different experimental paths and seeing how it looks on an "almost" production site.

The one thing I did to make this work with my Nuxt static site, is I use the

```json
app_build_command: "npm run generate"
```

as opposed to the built-in script, which I think is

```bash
npm run build
```

and this allows me to have my static site generated and fully rendered by the Nuxt tooling and pushed up to the Azure Static Web App.
