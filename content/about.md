## My Background and Start

I started programming with my father in qBASIC in the early 1990's and progressed to Visual Basic 4 on Windows 3.1 (yes, the 16-bit version.) I started using Microsoft Access and Classic ASP to build websites. I built a stats tracking databases to track gaming progress of my friends and myself by extracting the data from the game servers log files. This set me on the path to programming, and I've never looked back. Through high school and college I studied programming, graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in Computer Science.

In order to facilitate my hobby of gaming, I spent a lot of time learning how to run a game server in my basement. I spent some time throughout my career as a sys-admin as well. I use the skills and knowledge gained through those experiences to develop and design robust, scalable, and resilient software systems.

When .NET 1.0 was released, I jumped on the band wagon, but I stuck with VB. With the release of .NET 2.0 I switched to C#. I started looking at Open Source software, reading more code, reading blogs, and listening to podcasts. I started honing my craft based on these new inputs, and I continue to improve my skills and learn new things at every opportunity.

## About Me

I enjoy classic cars, swing music, and all sorts of Americana. In my teenage years, I was really into yo-yos. I was pretty good and even participated in some competitions. I enjoy road trips and I love trains, Amtrak is great and I'm an avid rider. Old time steam engines are so powerful and awesome and they are my true train passion.
